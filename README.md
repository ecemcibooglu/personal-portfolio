<h3>Portfolio Website</h3> 

<p>In this project, I will take the structure from the basic-HTML-website project and apply various CSS techniques to enhance its appearance and responsiveness.</p>


<p>The requirements for the website are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fully styled, responsive website with the same structure as the previous project.</li>
<li>Consistent use of a chosen color scheme and typography.</li>
<li>Proper use of CSS techniques like Flexbox, media queries, and the box model.</li>
<li>A responsive navigation bar and well-styled contact form.</li>
</ul>
